# Ares Media

Ares is a game by Nathan Lamont produced under the banner of Bigger Planet. See [biggerplanet.com/ares](https://biggerplanet.com/ares) for details.

## About the Ares Media

This repository includes most of the raw media used in the game Ares. Some sounds have been excluded because I do not have the right transfer their licenses, i.e. they are not sufficiently original works. See "Sounds That Were Excluded.txt." All movies have been exluded but are available in a separate repo under a slightly more restrictive license.

I have extracted the most interesting resources as individual files, and I have included the original resource files as well, except the sound file.

I also did not include the original resource file for the application, which includes the Ambrosia logo, which I obviously don't have the right to distribute under a CC license.

### A Request

Please use "OpenAres," "Ares Classic," or some other alternative instead of just "Ares" in the title of any derivative works. If I decide to create a new game based on Ares, I'd rather not have it confused with derivatives of my prior work. Therefore I wish to strongly discourage the release of additional games called "Ares" which may be interpreted as my own.

For example, it would make me unhappy to have someone else release something called "Ares 2."

### The Code

The source code is not part of this distribution. See biggerplanet.com/ares for the code.
